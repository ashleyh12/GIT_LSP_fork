Why I love it: Many kids will recognize themselves in the Elephantâ€™s Child and his (in)satiable curiosity.
 After you read this one, have students come up with stories for the way other animals got their unique features.
 How did the giraffe get its long neck? How did the turtle get its shell? So 
 many possibilities!
